  "description": "A comforting and aromatic stew where fresh fish is gently simmered in a flavorful tomato-based sauce with onions, garlic, and traditional seasonings. Unlike the 'dry' version, this stew has a generous amount of savory broth that perfectly soaks into starchy accompaniments. The fish remains tender and flaky while absorbing the rich flavors of the sauce, creating a harmonious and satisfying meal.",

It represents the bounty of Uganda's aquatic resources and is a weekly staple in many households, often prepared for Friday dinners or Sunday family lunches. The dish symbolizes nourishment and family care, as it's often made with love for the whole family. The ability to cook fish to perfect tenderness without it falling apart is a valued culinary skill passed from mothers to daughters."
