  "description": "A majestic and deeply flavorful dish where chunks of beef are slow-steamed for hours in a sealed banana leaf pouch with a rich groundnut paste and aromatic vegetables. This traditional cooking method transforms tough cuts of meat into incredibly tender, fall-apart morsels bathing in a thick, nutty, and intensely savory sauce. The banana leaf imparts a unique earthy aroma that defines this royal dish.",
