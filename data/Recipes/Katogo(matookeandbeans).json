  "description": "A hearty, comforting one-pot dish where green bananas (matooke) and beans are cooked together until tender, creating a thick, savory stew. The matooke absorbs the flavorful bean broth while becoming soft and creamy, resulting in a complete, nutritious meal that embodies Ugandan home cooking at its most comforting. This is the ultimate breakfast katogo that provides sustained energy throughout the day.",

    "cultural_notes": "Katogo is the quintessential Ugandan comfort food, famously eaten as a substantial breakfast that can power you through until evening. The matooke and beans version is particularly beloved in Central Uganda. It represents the wisdom of one-pot cooking where ingredients cook together, exchanging flavors. Traditionally, katogo is cooked overnight on low heat or early in the morning to be ready for breakfast. It's a dish that says 'home' to most Ugandans and is often associated with weekend family meals and special morning gatherings."
