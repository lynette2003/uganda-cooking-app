  "description": "A traditional and highly nutritious dish made from the tender leaves of the cowpea plant. Eboo has a distinctive earthy, slightly bitter flavor and a mucilaginous (slightly slimy) texture when cooked, similar to okra. This texture is highly valued and helps to thicken the sauce, making it perfect for scooping with Ugali or Posho.",

It represents resilience and the deep connection to local flora."
