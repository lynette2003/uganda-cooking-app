  "description": "A rich, creamy, and uniquely flavored dish made by blending thick, fermented sour milk with a smooth, savory groundnut paste. The tangy, sharp notes of the sour milk are beautifully balanced by the nutty, earthy richness of the groundnuts, creating a thick, protein-packed sauce or paste that is both refreshing and deeply satisfying. It can be served as a thick drink, a dip, or a sauce.",

    "cultural_notes": "This combination is a powerhouse of nutrition, commonly prepared in households that have easy access to both milk from their cattle and home-grown groundnuts. It is often given to children and the elderly for its high protein and fat content. It represents the pastoralist culture of Western Uganda, combining two of their most important food resources into one simple, yet profoundly nourishing, dish. It's a quick energy booster for herders."
