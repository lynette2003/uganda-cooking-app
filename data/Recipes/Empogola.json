    "cultural_notes": "Empogola is a cherished traditional cooking method from Western Uganda, deeply rooted in the pastoralist cultures of Ankole and Kigezi. The process involves carefully arranging the bananas around a smoking fire, often using specific types of wood for flavor. This method not only cooks the bananas but also preserves them. The smoky flavor is highly valued, and eating Empogola is a nostalgic experience for many from the region, evoking memories of rural homesteads and open-fire cooking."
