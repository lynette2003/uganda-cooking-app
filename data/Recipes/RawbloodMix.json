It is primarily consumed by warriors, elders, and those needing strength recovery. The dish is prepared immediately after animal slaughter and is believed to transfer the animal's vitality to the consumer. Among the Karamojong, it's called 'Emyonyi' and is considered essential for warriors. In other communities, it's a ceremonial food that reinforces cultural identity and connection to livestock. Consumption is governed by strict cultural protocols and is not part of everyday meals."
