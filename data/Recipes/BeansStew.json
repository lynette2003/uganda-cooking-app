They are served in virtually every school feeding program, most local restaurants ('kafunda'), and are a daily feature in home cooking. The ability to cook beans to perfect tenderness without burning is a basic but vital culinary skill. Beans are often cooked in large batches to last for several meals, representing practicality and resourcefulness in everyday Ugandan life."
