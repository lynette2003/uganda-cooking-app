  "description": "A simple, wholesome, and incredibly popular snack of fresh, immature groundnuts (peanuts) boiled in their shells with salt. The result is a uniquely soft, juicy, and savory nut with a texture and flavor entirely different from roasted peanuts. The act of cracking the warm, wet shells to get to the tender nuts inside is a quintessential Ugandan experience.",

    "cultural_notes": "Boiled groundnuts are the taste of the rainy season when fresh groundnuts are harvested. They are sold in heaps on woven trays (obutala) by roadside vendors, in markets, and at bus parks. They are a social snack, often shared among friends and family while chatting. The piles of shells left behind are a common sight. For many, the smell of boiling groundnuts is a powerful reminder of home and season."
