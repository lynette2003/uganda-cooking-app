  "description": "A flavorful and comforting dish of Irish potatoes boiled with onions, tomatoes, and basic seasonings until tender and infused with savory goodness. Unlike plain boiled potatoes, Obumonde creates its own light, flavorful broth during cooking, making it a complete and satisfying one-pot meal. The potatoes absorb the flavors of the aromatics, resulting in a deliciously seasoned dish that stands well on its own.",
