It is highly valued for its nutritional properties and is often given to new mothers, the elderly, or those recovering from illness for its high iron content. The dish represents the principle of zero waste in traditional animal husbandry, where every part of the animal is utilized. Preparing and eating Mala connects communities to ancestral foodways and traditional knowledge about the nutritional use of animal parts."
