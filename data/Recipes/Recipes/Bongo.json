  "description": "A thick, tangy, and slightly effervescent fermented milk, traditionally prepared in long, dried gourds. Bongo is a staple for the Ankole, Banyoro, and Batooro people of Western Uganda. It has a complex, sour flavor profile, similar to a very strong, natural yogurt or kefir, and is valued for its refreshing qualities and long shelf life without refrigeration.",

    "cultural_notes": "Bongo is deeply intertwined with the culture of the cattle-keeping communities in Western Uganda. The long-horned Ankole cattle are a symbol of status and wealth, and their milk is a primary food source. Preparing Bongo in a special gourd (ekyano) is a traditional skill passed down through generations. It is a sign of hospitality to offer a visitor Bongo. The distinct taste and method of production are a proud marker of cultural identity for the people of this region."
