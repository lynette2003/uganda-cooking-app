  "description": "A regal and aromatic dish where chicken is marinated with traditional spices, wrapped in banana leaves with a rich groundnut paste, and slowly steamed to perfection. The banana leaf pouch locks in all the moisture and flavors, resulting in incredibly tender, juicy chicken immersed in a thick, nutty, and deeply savory sauce. It is the pinnacle of Ugandan celebratory cooking.",
