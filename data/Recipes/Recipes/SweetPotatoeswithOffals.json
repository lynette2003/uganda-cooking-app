    "cultural_notes": "This version of Katogo is considered a 'breakfast of champions' for those doing hard physical labor. It's a dish that showcases the 'nose-to-tail' eating philosophy, making use of every part of the animal. It's particularly popular in central Uganda and is a common sight in local breakfast joints (canteens) and bus parks, served to give people energy for the long day ahead. The long, slow cooking is essential to tenderize the offals and meld the flavors."
