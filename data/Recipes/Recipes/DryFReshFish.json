  "description": "A robust and aromatic stew where fresh fish is simmered with tomatoes, onions, and traditional seasonings until the liquid reduces to create a thick, concentrated sauce that clings to the fish. Unlike soupy stews, this 'dry' version has minimal liquid, allowing the flavors to intensify and the fish to remain firm and flavorful. It's a perfect balance of tender fish and savory, reduced vegetables.",

    "cultural_notes": "This dry fish stew is a staple in households across Uganda, particularly in communities near lakes and rivers. It represents practical, everyday cooking that maximizes flavor with minimal ingredients. The 'dry' cooking method is preferred by many because it creates an intensely flavorful dish that pairs perfectly with starchy staples. It's commonly prepared for family dinners and is especially popular in fishing communities where fresh fish is readily available. The technique of reducing the sauce to a thick consistency is a cherished culinary skill passed through generations."
