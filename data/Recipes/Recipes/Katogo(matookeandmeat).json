  "description": "A rich, hearty one-pot dish where tender green bananas (matooke) are steamed and cooked in a flavorful meat stew until both are melt-in-your-mouth tender. The matooke absorbs the savory meat juices and spices, creating a harmonious blend of textures and flavors that is the ultimate Ugandan comfort food. This katogo is particularly special due to the luxurious addition of meat.",
