    "cultural_notes": "Egg fried rice has become a go-to meal in Ugandan urban households, particularly among students, young professionals, and busy families. It represents the perfect fusion of convenience and nutrition in modern Ugandan cooking. The dish is especially popular because it can be made quickly with basic ingredients most households have on hand. It's commonly prepared for breakfast using leftover rice from the previous night, or as a quick dinner after a long day. Many Ugandan cooks have adapted the classic fried rice by adding local spices and vegetables, making it their own."
