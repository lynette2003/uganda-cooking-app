  "description": "A traditional and flavorful preparation of Nakati (African  leaves) where the vegetable is steamed inside a banana leaf pouch. This cooking method gently softens the nakati's characteristic bitterness while infusing it with a subtle, smoky-sweet aroma from the leaf, resulting in a uniquely tender and aromatic side dish.",
