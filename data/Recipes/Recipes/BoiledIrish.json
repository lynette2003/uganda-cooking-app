They are a common sight in school feeding programs, hospital meals, and everyday household cooking. Their simplicity makes them incredibly versatile - they can be eaten as is, mashed with a fork, or served alongside virtually any sauce, stew, or vegetable. For many, this is the ultimate comfort food - simple, filling, and nourishing. The ability to perfectly boil potatoes without them becoming waterlogged is a basic but essential kitchen skill."
