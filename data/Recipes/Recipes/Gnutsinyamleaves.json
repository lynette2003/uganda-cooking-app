  "description": "A hearty and flavorful dish where tender yam leaves are simmered in a thick, creamy, and nutty groundnut sauce.

    "cultural_notes": "This dish is a celebration of utilizing the entire yam plant—the tubers as a carbohydrate and the leaves as a vegetable. It is a common preparation in regions where yams are cultivated. Combining these leaves with groundnut sauce elevates a simple foraged green into a protein-rich, main-course stew. It exemplifies the 'zero-waste' philosophy and deep agricultural knowledge inherent in Ugandan food culture, turning a humble ingredient into a culinary delight."
