    "cultural_notes": "Waragi is more than a drink; it's a deep-seated part of Ugandan social life. Its name is a contraction of 'War Gin', tracing back to its consumption by soldiers. It is the most consumed spirit in Uganda, often sold in small sachets. While commercially produced brands like Uganda Waragi (made from millet) are safe and regulated, illicit local distillation is a dangerous but persistent practice in rural areas, often leading to fatal poisonings. It is a drink of the people, symbolizing both community and, at times, peril."
