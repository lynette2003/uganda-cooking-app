Simsim (sesame) has been cultivated in Uganda for generations and is valued for its nutritional benefits. This dish is often prepared for family gatherings and is considered especially beneficial for children and pregnant women due to its high calcium and protein content. It represents the harmonious combination of Uganda's aquatic resources with traditional oilseed cultivation."
