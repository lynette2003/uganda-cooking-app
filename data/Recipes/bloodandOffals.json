  "description": "A rich, deeply flavorful traditional dish that combines fresh animal blood with a variety of organ meats (offals) including liver, heart, kidneys, and tripe. This nutrient-dense preparation creates a complex texture and intense savory flavor that is highly valued in traditional cuisine. The blood forms a dark, thick sauce that coats the tender organ meats, resulting in a dish that is both hearty and packed with essential nutrients.",

    "cultural_notes": "This dish represents the ultimate expression of 'nose-to-tail' eating in Ugandan culture. It is typically prepared immediately after animal slaughter when all the fresh ingredients are available. Different offals may be assigned to specific family members or guests as a sign of respect - for example, the liver might be reserved for elders. The dish is believed to provide strength and vitality, and is often given to new mothers, growing children, or those recovering from illness. Preparing and sharing this meal reinforces community bonds and traditional knowledge about using every part of the animal."
