    "cultural_notes": "Grilled chicken is the centerpiece of celebration and leisure in Uganda. On weekends, the aroma of chicken grilling over charcoal fills neighborhoods and wafts from roadside 'Muchomo' joints. 'Muchomo' (meaning 'roasted meat') is a social event where friends gather to eat grilled meat and drink. Preparing grilled chicken is associated with hospitality, festivity, and good times. The skill lies in achieving a perfectly cooked interior with a smoky, crispy exterior."
